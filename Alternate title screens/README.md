# Alternative Title Screens

Download desired title screens here.  If you really want a specific style, feel free to contact me about it.  
Or you can try making your own.  I will upload the tools soon.

Example Image : this is the en.good-loot-ahead title screen

# Instructions

Download 1 or 2 en.<whatever> files from here and move them into your Cataclysm DDA /data/title folder

Take the one you wish to be the main title screen and rename it to *en.title*.

For a 2nd title screen that randomly appears sometimes, rename it to *en.alt1*.
