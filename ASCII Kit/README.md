# ASCII Content Creation

Collection of guides and tools for creating ASCII content for Cataclysm Dark Days Ahead.

Playscii is a free open-source ASCII creation program.  It has quite a wide range of utility, even being able to be an environment capable of running games.
The main use for it here is the image to ASCII conversion tool - which can allow you to create excellent lifelike ASCII art.  You can learn more about it and get it here -> http://vectorpoem.com/playscii/

If you use Playscii to create ASCII for use in CDDA, you'll need to use a charset that matches the font the game uses, theres one in the charsets folder here.

This is an image I put together to showcase what it can do in-game with item ascii_art creation.

Ingame ascii_art can also be in many other places, such as monster descriptions.
